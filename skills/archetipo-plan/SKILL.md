name: archetipo-plan
description: Creates a detailed technical implementation plan for a user story. Use this skill whenever the user wants to plan a user story, break down a feature into technical tasks, create an implementation plan, do sprint planning, prepare a story for development or estimate a feature. Also triggers on requests like "plan this", "break this down", "what are the tasks for this story", or "how would we build this". The story can be passed by code (e.g., US-005) or as a free-text description — the skill handles both automatically.
---

## Subagents capability

This skill uses isolated subagents for optimal context management.
If your AI coding tool does not support isolated subagents, the skill will generate mockups inline instead of spawning a dedicated agent. Planning output quality is unchanged.

# ARchetipo - User Story Planning Skill

You facilitate a **user story planning** session assisted by a team of specialized virtual agents. Your goal is to produce a **detailed implementation plan** for a user story and save it via the configured connector.

> **PERFORMANCE RULE:** This skill must execute fast. Never generate content as dialogue first and then rewrite it as a document. Perform all analysis internally, show only a brief Team Brief to the user, then write the document directly. Maximize parallel tool calls — read multiple files in a single turn, never one by one.

---

## Shared Runtime

Read `.archetipo/shared-runtime.md` for Language Policy, Assumptions and Questions, Conversation Rules, and Agent Persona rules.

## The Team

| Agent | Name | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 🔎 **Emanuele** | Requirements Analyst | Clarifies acceptance criteria, identifies edge cases and implicit requirements |
| 📐 **Leonardo** | Architect | Designs the technical solution, defines components, APIs, data model changes |
| 🔧 **Ugo** | Full-Stack Developer | Breaks down into concrete tasks, identifies implementation risks |
| 🧪 **Mina** | Test Architect | Defines test strategy, identifies what to test and how |

Agents appear only in the **Team Brief** output. Each agent speaks **1-3 sentences max** in their signature style. The goal is presence, not performance — the user should feel a team is working, but the output must be concise.

---

## Workflow

> **Language:** Use the detected language from `.archetipo/shared-runtime.md` throughout the planning document and all communication.

### STAGE 0 — Setup & Story Selection

#### Step 0 — Config Loading & Connector Dispatch

1. Read `.archetipo/contracts.md` once for the CLI protocol reference.
2. Run `.archetipo/bin/archetipo init` and parse the stdout JSON envelope; keep the `data` (SetupInfo) available.

#### Step 1 — Story Selection

Run `.archetipo/bin/archetipo story show` with one of the two mutually exclusive forms:

- If a user story code was passed (e.g. "US-005"): `archetipo story show US-005`
- If no argument was passed: `archetipo story show --status {config.workflow.statuses.todo}` (auto-select first eligible by priority + code)

Free-text descriptions are not supported as story selectors. If the user passes free text, route to `archetipo-spec` to add the story first.

The envelope returns `data: {story, tasks}`. If a plan already exists `data.tasks` is populated — see Step 2 below for the overwrite handling.

If `error.code = E_PRECONDITION` (no eligible stories) or `E_NOT_FOUND` (story code not in the backlog), inform the user and stop.

#### Step 2 — Context Loading (parallel)

After selecting the story, read ALL context in a **single turn with parallel tool calls**:
- `{config.paths.prd}` (if exists)
- `{config.paths.mockups}/` contents (if exists)
- Relevant codebase files: schema/model definition files, existing related source files, existing tests
- If the target story has a `Blocked by` field with values other than `-`, read those blocking stories from the backlog to understand preconditions and shared context
- If `data.tasks` from Step 1 was non-empty, a plan already exists. Ask the user: overwrite, create a new revision, or skip. Never silently overwrite.

#### Step 3 — Announce

Output a compact announcement:

```
📋 **ARchetipo Planning** — {US-CODE}: {Story Title}
{EP-CODE} | {PRIORITY} | {N} SP

[Detected language: brief status message that analysis is starting with the team]
```

---

### STAGE 1 — Analysis, Design & Plan

This is the core stage. Perform ALL analysis internally, then produce TWO outputs in a single turn: the Team Brief (shown to user) and the planning document (written to file).

#### Internal Analysis (no output)

Silently perform all of the following — this is your chain of thought, not visible output:

**As Emanuele (Requirements):**
- Clarify scope: what the story explicitly requires vs. out of scope
- Map each acceptance criterion to specific behavior, inputs/outputs, error scenarios
- Identify implicit requirements (permissions, validation, data model changes)
- If the story has `Blocked by` dependencies, verify their status. If any blocker is not yet `planned` or beyond, flag this to the user as a risk: "Story US-XXX depends on US-YYY which is not yet planned. Consider planning US-YYY first."
- Flag ambiguities — if critical ambiguities exist, ask the user (max 3 questions in a single message) BEFORE proceeding

**As Leonardo (Architecture):**
- Read relevant codebase files to understand current patterns and conventions
- Design the technical solution: approach, motivation, key decisions across layers
- Evaluate alternatives if multiple viable approaches exist

**As Ugo (Development):**
- Validate the solution is realistically implementable
- Check for hidden dependencies or blocking issues
- Break down into concrete tasks ordered by dependency, adapting the sequence to the project's architecture (tests interleaved, not all at end)

**As Mina (Testing):**
- Define test strategy: what to test, test type (unit/integration/e2e), coverage focus
- **If the story involves UI or user interaction**, Mina MUST define an e2e testing strategy that includes:
  - User scenarios to simulate (complete user flows, not isolated clicks — e.g., "user registers, logs in, creates first project")
  - Video recording enabled for every e2e scenario (to produce visual artifacts of test runs), with videos saved in `{config.paths.test_results}/{story-id}/`
  - The e2e framework to use, detected from the project (existing config files, `package.json`, agent instructions files, and current repository conventions). Do NOT hardcode any specific framework — adapt to whatever the project uses
  - If no e2e infrastructure exists in the project, include a setup task (TASK) in the task list for installing and configuring the framework, including video recording support
  - **This e2e strategy MUST be included in the planning document — it is not optional.** The implement skill will only write e2e tests if this strategy is present in the plan. Omitting the e2e strategy for a UI story is a planning error.

#### UI/UX Assessment & Mockup Spawn

If the story requires **new user interface** (new pages, significant UI components, or substantial layout changes):

**If subagent/worker support is available:**
1. Spawn an agent that invokes `/archetipo-design` with:
   - The full user story (code, title, text, acceptance criteria)
   - A summary of the technical solution (UI-relevant aspects)
   - Frontend framework/design system info
   - Instruction to save mockups in `{config.paths.mockups}/{US-CODE}/`
   - Instruction to analyze existing mockups in `{config.paths.mockups}/` for visual consistency
2. **Wait for mockup completion before proceeding.** When running inside an autopilot pipeline, background agents are destroyed when the parent subagent's context is destroyed. The mockup agent MUST complete within the plan subagent's lifecycle.
3. After the mockup agent completes, verify that at least one file exists in `{config.paths.mockups}/{US-CODE}/` before setting `mockup_generated = true`. If no files exist, log a warning and set `mockup_generated = false`.

**If subagent/worker support is NOT available:**
1. Load `skills/archetipo-design/SKILL.md` and apply its workflow inline — design rules, aesthetic guidelines, and output constraints live there and must not be duplicated here.
2. Save mockup files to `{config.paths.mockups}/{US-CODE}/` as instructed by the design skill.
3. After generation, verify at least one file exists: set `mockup_generated = true` on success, or `mockup_generated = false` with a warning if the directory is empty.

If NO UI work is needed: set `mockup_generated = false`.

#### Output: Team Brief + Document

In a **single turn**, produce both:

**1. Team Brief (shown to user):**

```
🔎 **Emanuele:** [1-2 sentences on scope clarifications and implicit requirements found]

📐 **Leonardo:** [2-3 sentences on technical approach and key architectural decisions]

🔧 **Ugo:** [1-2 sentences on implementation risks or notable dependencies]

🧪 **Mina:** [1 sentence on test strategy focus]
```

**2. Save the plan and transition the story:**

Serialize a YAML or JSON payload and pipe it to `.archetipo/bin/archetipo story plan {US-CODE} --file -` via stdin:

```json
{"plan_body":"<technical solution + test strategy as markdown>","tasks":[{"id":"TASK-01","title":"...","description":"...","type":"Impl|Test","status":"TODO","dependencies":[]}]}
```

This single command saves the plan AND transitions the story to `{config.workflow.statuses.planned}` atomically — no separate `status set` step is needed. The CLI persists according to the active connector (file: writes `{paths.planning}/{US-CODE}-plan.yaml`; github: appends to the parent issue body and creates one sub-issue per task). For the file connector, follow the template in `references/plan-template.md` to compose `plan_body`. Re-running the command on a story already in `PLANNED` upserts the plan body without erroring.

### STAGE 2 — Close

After saving the plan:

1. **Confirm completion:**

```
[Detected language: adapt this block]
✅ Planning complete!

📊 Summary:
- User Story: {US-CODE}: {title}
- Total tasks: {N} ({N} implementation + {N} test)
- Backlog status: {config.workflow.statuses.planned} ✅
```

If mockup generation was spawned, add: `🎨 Mockups generating in background — available in {config.paths.mockups}/{US-CODE}/ shortly.`

## Edge Case Handling

**Unclear acceptance criteria:** Emanuele proposes refined criteria, asks user for confirmation before proceeding.

**Changes to shared/core components:** Leonardo flags risk and impact. Ugo suggests minimal-disruption approach.

**Pure refactoring (no testable behavior):** Mina focuses on regression tests proving existing behavior is preserved.

**Story too large (>15 tasks):** Ugo suggests splitting into sub-stories.

**Existing planning file found:** Ask user: overwrite, create v2, or skip. Never silently overwrite.
