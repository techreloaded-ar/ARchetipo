# ARchetipo Implement — Output Templates

> **Language rule:** All structural labels, headers, and user-facing messages in these templates must be rendered in the detected project language (see Language Policy in `.archetipo/shared-runtime.md`).  
> Exception: agent names and role identifiers (Ugo, Mina, Cesare) are part of the ARchetipo brand voice and remain unchanged across languages.

```

### No planned stories

```text
❌ **Ugo:** No user stories in status {config.workflow.statuses.planned} found in the backlog.
   Run `/archetipo-plan` to plan a story, or pass a different story as argument.
```

### No implementation plan

```text
❌ **Ugo:** No implementation plan found for this story.
   The story has not been planned yet. Run first:

## Wave Execution Plan (Phase 1, Step 6)

```text
🔧 **Ugo:** I've analyzed the tasks from the plan. Here is how we will execute them:

**Execution context:** Worker-backed preferred | In-context fallback

**Wave 1 — Sequential workers**
- 🔧 Ugo: TASK-01 [description]
- 🧪 Mina: TASK-02 [description]

**Reason for sequential scheduling:** [dependencies | shared files | unstable interfaces]

**Wave 2 — Concurrent workers**
- 🔧 Ugo: TASK-03 [description]
- 🧪 Mina: TASK-04 [description]

**Fallback to current context:** [only if workers are unavailable or unreliable]

Proceeding.
```
