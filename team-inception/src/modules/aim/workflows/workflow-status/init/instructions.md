- Product Brief: {output_folder}/\*brief\*.md
- Research docs: {output_folder}/\*research\*.md
- Brainstorm docs: {output_folder}/\*brainstorm\*.md

**Check for implementation artifacts:**

- The following could be in or nested under {output_folder} OR {sprint_artifacts} - CHECK BOTH LOCATIONS
  - Story files: {output_folder}/stories/*.md or \*\*/stories/*story\*.md
  - Sprint status: {output_folder}/sprint-status.yaml or {sprint_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml
  - Existing workflow status: {default_output_file} or {sprint_artifacts}/aim-workflow-status.yaml

**Check for codebase:**

- Source code directories: src/, lib/, app/, components/, etc.
- Package files: package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod, pom.xml, etc.
- Git repository: .git/
- Framework indicators: next.config.js, vite.config.js, etc.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 **AIRchetipo Lite** - Fast Implementation Path

⏱️ **Time:** Hours to 1 day of planning
📝 **Approach:** Tech-spec focused - just enough detail to start coding
✅ **Best for:** Simple features, bug fixes, scope is crystal clear
⚠️ **Trade-off:** Less upfront planning = higher risk of rework if complexity emerges
🤖 **Agent Support:** Basic - AI will have minimal context

**Example:** "Fix login bug" or "Add export button"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 **AIRchetipo** - Full Product Planning (RECOMMENDED)

⏱️ **Time:** 1-3 days of planning
📝 **Approach:** PRD + UX + Architecture - complete product and system design
✅ **Best for:**

- **GREENFIELD:** Products, platforms, multi-feature initiatives
- **BROWNFIELD:** Complex additions (new UIs + APIs, major refactors, new modules)

✅ **Benefits:**

- AI agents have COMPLETE context for better code generation
- Architecture distills massive codebases into focused solution design
- Prevents architectural drift and ensures consistency
- Fewer surprises and less rework during implementation
- Faster overall delivery (planning investment pays off!)
- Better code quality and maintainability

🤖 **Agent Support:** Exceptional - AI becomes a true coding partner with full context

{{#if brownfield}}
💡 **Why Architecture for Brownfield?**
Your brownfield documentation might be huge (thousands of lines). The Architecture
workflow takes all that context and creates a SUCCINCT solution design specific to
YOUR project. This keeps AI agents focused on YOUR changes without getting lost
in the existing codebase details.
{{/if}}

**Example:** "User dashboard with analytics" or "Payment integration system"
or "Add real-time collaboration to existing editor"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏢 **AIRchetipo Enterprise** - Extended Enterprise Planning

⏱️ **Time:** 3-7 days of planning
📝 **Approach:** AIRchetipo + Security Architecture + DevOps + Test Strategy
✅ **Best for:** Enterprise requirements, compliance, multi-tenant, mission-critical
✅ **Benefits:** All of AIRchetipo PLUS specialized planning for:

- Security architecture and threat modeling
- DevOps pipeline and infrastructure planning
- Comprehensive test strategy
- Compliance and audit requirements

🤖 **Agent Support:** Elite - comprehensive planning for complex enterprise systems

**Example:** "Multi-tenant SaaS platform" or "HIPAA-compliant patient portal"
or "Add SOC2-compliant audit logging to enterprise app"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━</output>

<action>Generate recommendation based on user_description and field_type:

**Recommendation Logic:**

- Complexity keywords (dashboard, platform, system, integration, multiple features) → Recommend AIRchetipo
- Simple keywords (fix, bug, add button, simple) → Mention Quick Flow as option
- Enterprise keywords (multi-tenant, compliance, security, audit) → Recommend Enterprise
- Brownfield + complex → Strongly recommend Method (explain architecture benefit)

3. For each workflow in phase:
   - Check if workflow should be included based on user choices
   - Add entry: `  {workflow-id}: {default_status}  # agent: {agent}`
   - Default status from path file (required/optional/recommended/conditional)
   - Agent from path file (pm/architect/ux-designer/analyst/strategist/etc.)
